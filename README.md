The git commands that I will most commonly use are Add and Commit. Without those, you can't do anything as files must be staged and then commited in order to be saved. 
The next most common commands I will use are Pull and Push, as in most situations you'll have a remote git repository, and Pull and Push allow access to that.
The next most common commands are Branch and checkout, as these allows for the creation and switching of branches. To be able to work on something and not have to worry about breaking something vital is important.
